# TypeIT
Project built using python (tkinter) that calculates the speed and accuracy of the keyboard typing of a user and maintains a local database of multiple users managed my MySQL

The .py file is not readily executable, as this is my first project, the program works only with the required files and dbs being located in a certain directory. 
You may go through the documentation for further details.
